This repository contains Jupyter notebooks describing metabolic pathways for Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
using [python](https://www.python.org/) and [pydna](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna) . 
These files accompany the publication:

These notebooks can be visialized in a number of ways. 
There are static html files that can be opened in a browser directly.
The notebooks can be opened in the browser through the nbviewer service 
[here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MetabolicEngineeringGroupCBMA/Cunha_et_al_2017/blob/master/index.ipynb) 
or directly in Github [here](index.ipynb)

Each notebook contain links (usually in the end) to the resulting sequences in Genbank flat file format.

These notebooks are tested on the TravisCI build service at least once a month.
This means that the notebook outputs are executed and compared with the old saved results.
If the badge below is green, all tests gave the expected results.
